The task: 
A 9x9 matrix is randomly filled with numbers from 0 to 3 inclusive. (Made in string format for clarity).
If 3 or more numbers coincide horizontally/vertically, remove them by shifting all the elements of the matrix from top to bottom, filling in the empty space. (I print each step to make it convenient to check the correctness) The remaining empty elements are filled with random numbers from 0 to 3 inclusive. Repeat the procedure until there are no matches. Print or store the result.
